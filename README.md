# RestaurantApp
This is the restaurant app that was created by Miles and his teammates. It is a prototype that allows customers to place orders and cook to see upcoming orders. It incorporates a priority system that makes sure an order is never skipped more than 3 times by higher priority orders. The main files Miles work on are CustomerView and OrderDataController.
